# Studying JavaScript since 2021

Welcome to my repository on GitHub! Here you will find a collection of study projects that I, Bruno, developed in JavaScript.

As a programming enthusiast, I'm constantly looking to expand my knowledge and skills in different areas. In this repository, you'll find a mix of projects that I've developed both as personal challenges and to practice specific concepts.

Each project is an opportunity for me to try out new ideas, explore new tools, and learn something new. I hope these projects can be useful to other programmers who are also looking to improve their JavaScript skills.

Some of the projects you'll find here include simple games like Snake and Tetris, as well as interactive web applications like calculators and task managers. All projects were developed using JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

Feel free to explore my repository, download the projects and try them out for yourself. If you have any feedback or suggestions for improvements, please don't hesitate to contact me.

Thanks for visiting my repository and I hope you find the projects here useful and inspiring!
